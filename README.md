## This is a React app build using create-react-app

In this project the user can choose ingredients of their burger and checkout. The order will be saved in a database on firebase. However at this time the app is not able to display the previous orders (this will be added later).

### How to run this app on your local machine

1. clone the repository
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'npm start'  <-- this should open a browser, if it fails to do that then open a browser and head over to https://localhost/3000
